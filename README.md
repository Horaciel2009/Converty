```

2. **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install FFmpeg** (if not already installed)

- **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to your PATH
- **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`

```

## üîß Configuration

The application creates two folders automatically:
- `uploads/`: Stores uploaded media files

You can modify these paths in the `app.py` file if needed.

## üåê Language Support

The language can be changed using the language selector in the header.

## üîç How It Works

1. Upload your media file (image or video) by dragging and dropping it onto the upload area or clicking to browse
2. The application will automatically detect if it's an image or video
3. Select your desired output format from the dropdown menu (options will be based on your file type)
4. Click the "Convert" button to process the media file
5. Once conversion is complete, the file will automatically download
